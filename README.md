# PRODIGY_DS-04
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards trending topics and popular entities.

##  Objective

This project aims to explore how users express opinions on Twitter. The sentiment of tweets is classified into:
- ‚úÖ Positive  
- ‚ùå Negative  
- üòê Neutral  
- ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Irrelevant (ignored in modeling)


## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed URLs, mentions (@), hashtags (#), special characters
   - Converted all text to lowercase
   - Removed common English stopwords

2. **EDA & Visualization**
   - Sentiment distribution bar chart
   - Word clouds for positive and negative tweets
   - Entity-level sentiment breakdown (top 10 entities)

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - TF-IDF vectorization of cleaned tweets

4. **Modeling**
   - Trained a **Logistic Regression classifier**
   - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
